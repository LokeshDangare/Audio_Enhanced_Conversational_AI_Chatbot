# Audio_Enhanced_Conversational_AI_Chatbot

## Problem Statement
Audio-Enhanced Conversational AI Chatbot is a user friendly chatbot that transforms video or audio content into an interactive, conversational experience by transcribing audio, processing content for context and providing accurate, real-time answers to user questions.

## Reason behind developing the chatbot
People often consume a wealth of information via videos, webinars, and podcasts but lack efficient ways to interact with or query specific information within these media. The challenge lies in converting long-form audio or video content into an interactive experience, allowing users to ask questions and retrieve precise information from the content without manually searching or listening through the entire file.

## Steps to build the project
1. Transcribing audio from Youtube videos.
2. Processing and organizing this content for effective retrieval.
3. Create summary for entire transcript.
4. Enabling user to query and recieve accurate, context-based answers from the transcription using a Large Language Model(LLM).
